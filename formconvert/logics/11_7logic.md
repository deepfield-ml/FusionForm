## Relational Transformation Formula for Formation Conversion

This formula provides a rule-based approach to convert 11-a-side football formations to 7-a-side, prioritizing the preservation and adaptation of tactical roles and relationships.

**1. Define 11-a-side Roles and Relationships (Input):**

Represent your 11-a-side formation as a set of roles (R<sub>11</sub>) and understand their key partnerships/units.

**Example Roles (for a 4-4-2):**

* `R<sub>11</sub> = {CD<sub>R</sub>, CD<sub>L</sub>, FB<sub>R</sub>, FB<sub>L</sub>, CM<sub>C</sub>, CM<sub>D</sub>, WM<sub>R</sub>, WM<sub>L</sub>, ST<sub>F</sub>, ST<sub>T</sub>}`
    * `CD<sub>R</sub>`: Right Center-Back
    * `CD<sub>L</sub>`: Left Center-Back
    * `FB<sub>R</sub>`: Right Full-Back
    * `FB<sub>L</sub>`: Left Full-Back
    * `CM<sub>C</sub>`: Central Midfielder (Creator/Box-to-box)
    * `CM<sub>D</sub>`: Defensive Midfielder
    * `WM<sub>R</sub>`: Right Wide Midfielder
    * `WM<sub>L</sub>`: Left Wide Midfielder
    * `ST<sub>F</sub>`: Forward Striker
    * `ST<sub>T</sub>`: Target Striker

**2. Prioritized Role Retention and Transformation Rules (Ordered Rules):**

Apply these rules in order to derive the 7-a-side roles (R<sub>7</sub>).

* **Rule 1: Preserve Central Defensive Core:**

R<sub>7</sub>_CD = SELECT(2, from {CD<sub>R</sub>, CD<sub>L</sub>, FB<sub>R</sub>, FB<sub>L</sub>}, prioritize CD roles)

* **Explanation:** Select 2 central defenders for 7-a-side. Prioritize original Center-Back roles (`CD<sub>R</sub>, CD<sub>L</sub>`).

* **Rule 2: Maintain Central Midfield Control:**

R<sub>7</sub>_CM = SELECT(2, from {CM<sub>C</sub>, CM<sub>D</sub>, WM<sub>R</sub>, WM<sub>L</sub>, Remaining_FB/WB from Rule 1}, prioritize CM roles)

* **Explanation:** Select 2 central midfielders for 7-a-side. Prioritize original Central Midfielders (`CM<sub>C</sub>, CM<sub>D</sub>`). Then consider Wide Midfielders or remaining Full-backs adaptable to central midfield.

* **Rule 3: Create an Attacking Focus (Central or Dual):**

R<sub>7</sub>_ST = SELECT(1, from {ST<sub>F</sub>, ST<sub>T</sub>, WM<sub>R</sub>, WM<sub>L</sub>, Remaining_FB/WB/WM from Rules 1 & 2}, prioritize ST roles)

* **Explanation:** Select 1 attacker. Prioritize original Striker roles (`ST<sub>F</sub>, ST<sub>T</sub>`). Then consider Wide Midfielders or remaining roles that can be attacking.

* **Rule 4: Adapt Remaining Roles for Width and Balance (Flexibility):**

R<sub>7</sub>_Flex = SELECT(remaining roles from R<sub>11</sub> - (R<sub>7</sub>_CD ∪ R<sub>7</sub>_CM ∪ R<sub>7</sub>_ST), prioritize versatile roles for width/balance)


* **Explanation:** Select remaining roles (if any) for flexibility. Prioritize roles that can provide width, support defense or attack, based on versatility.

**3. Construct 7-a-side Formation (Output):**

Based on the selected roles in `R<sub>7</sub>_CD`, `R<sub>7</sub>_CM`, `R<sub>7</sub>_ST`, `R<sub>7</sub>_Flex`, determine the 7-a-side formation count (e.g., 2 Defenders - 2 Midfielders - 1 Attacker + 1 Flexible = 2-3-1 or 2-2-2 depending on flexible role positioning).

**Important Notes:**

* The `SELECT(N, from set, prioritize roles)` function implies choosing `N` roles from the given set based on the prioritization criteria. In a program, this could be implemented with conditional logic and role type checking.
* This formula is a guideline. Tactical adjustments based on specific player attributes and game context are always necessary.
